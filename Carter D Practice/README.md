# Carter Dermatology — Pro Site (v1)

A clean, professional, multi‑page dermatology website built from your ZIP and inspired by the references you provided (modern hero, services grid, doctor spotlight, and a Hensley‑style contact layout).

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home with hero, services preview, Dr. Carter spotlight, and booking form
- `services.html` — Medical, surgical, and cosmetic services
- `conditions.html` — Grid of common conditions
- `dr-carter.html` — Dr. Westley Carter biography
- `contact.html` — Contact/Location with map placeholder and message form

## Tech
- Fonts: Inter & Playfair Display (Google Fonts)
- Colors: Green palette from your prior spec (`--green`, `--green-2`, etc.)
- Fully responsive, accessible landmarks and labels
- Lightweight JS for mobile menu + form "toast" confirmations

## Customize
- Replace SVG placeholders in `assets/img/` with real photos
- Edit copy in each page section to match your practice
- Embed your Google Map in `.map-embed` on `contact.html`
- Wire forms to your backend or tools (e.g., HubSpot, Netlify Forms, Zapier)

## Deploy
Open `index.html` locally or upload the folder to your host (Netlify, Vercel, cPanel).
